## üìù **Word List Management**

### üéØ **Pre-loaded Educational Lists**
- **August 27th Lesson** - Complete curriculum-aligned word set
- **Default Collection** - Multi-level difficulty progression

### ‚ûï **Easy Custom Word Lists**
1. Click **"+ Add Word List"** during setup
2. Use the provided JSON template or the in-app **Download Template** button ([direct link](wordlists/example.csv))
3. Each word requires:
   ```json
   {
     "word": "example",
     "syllables": ["ex", "am", "ple"],
     "definition": "A thing characteristic of its kind",
     "origin": "Latin 'exemplum' meaning sample",
     "example": "This is a good example of the format.",
     "prefix": "",
     "suffix": "",
     "pronunciation": "ig-ZAM-pul"
   }
   ```

### ü§ñ **AI‚ÄëGenerated Word Lists**

Teachers can automatically create new lists using GitHub-hosted models.

**Prerequisite**: a GitHub account with access to [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/overview) and a personal access token.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken
# For OpenAI-compatible clients
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$GITHUB_TOKEN
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
```

**Example prompt**

> "Create 3 easy spelling bee words for 2nd graders. Return a JSON array of objects with word, syllables, definition, origin, example, prefix, suffix, pronunciation."

**Example usage**

```bash
curl -sL https://models.inference.ai.azure.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You generate spelling bee word lists in JSON."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Create 3 easy words for 2nd graders with definition, syllables and example."}
        ]
      }'
```

**Sample output**

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "[\n  {\n    \"word\": \"pencil\",\n    \"syllables\": [\"pen\", \"cil\"],\n    \"definition\": \"a tool for writing\",\n    \"origin\": \"Latin\",\n    \"example\": \"I sharpened my pencil.\",\n    \"prefix\": \"\",\n    \"suffix\": \"\",\n    \"pronunciation\": \"PEN-sil\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"word\": \"music\",\n    \"syllables\": [\"mu\", \"sic\"],\n    \"definition\": \"sounds that are sung or played\",\n    \"origin\": \"Greek\",\n    \"example\": \"She loves music.\",\n    \"prefix\": \"\",\n    \"suffix\": \"\",\n    \"pronunciation\": \"MYOO-zik\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"word\": \"garden\",\n    \"syllables\": [\"gar\", \"den\"],\n    \"definition\": \"a place to grow plants\",\n    \"origin\": \"Old English\",\n    \"example\": \"The garden has roses.\",\n    \"prefix\": \"\",\n    \"suffix\": \"\",\n    \"pronunciation\": \"GAR-den\"\n  }\n]"
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 63, "completion_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 185 }
}
```

Copy the array from `choices[0].message.content` into a file in `wordlists/`. The `usage` block shows token counts to help estimate costs.

## üîä **Audio Generation**

This project includes scripts to generate high-quality audio files using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API. The audio includes word pronunciations, UI feedback sounds, and sound effects.

### Prerequisites
1. **Get an API Key**
   - Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
   - Create an API key in your account settings

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your ElevenLabs API key to the `.env` file

### Generating Audio Files

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate Sound Effects**
   ```bash
   npm run generate:sfx
   ```
   This will create UI and feedback sounds in `public/audio/sfx/`

3. **Generate Word Pronunciations**
   ```bash
   npm run generate:audio
   ```
   This will generate audio files for all words in the word list

4. **Generate Everything**
   ```bash
   npm run generate:all-audio
   ```
   This will generate both sound effects and word pronunciations

### Audio File Structure
- `public/audio/words/` - Word pronunciation files (e.g., `apple.mp3`)
- `public/audio/sfx/` - Sound effects (e.g., `correct.mp3`, `wrong.mp3`)
- `public/audio/ui/` - UI interaction sounds (e.g., `click.mp3`)

### Customizing Audio
- Edit `scripts/generate-audio.ts` to modify word pronunciations
- Edit `scripts/generate-sfx.ts` to modify sound effects
- Update voice settings in `.env`

## üöÄ **Build & Deployment**

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the project (outputs files to `dist/`):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This generates `dist/app.js`, `dist/tailwind.css`, and copies required assets.
3. Deploy or serve the contents of the `dist/` directory.

> Built files are no longer committed to the repository and are produced during the build step.

## üîß **Customization Options**

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Modifications** (Edit `spelling-bee-game.tsx` then run `npm run build` to generate `dist/app.js`)
```javascript
// Change timer duration
setTimeLeft(30) // 30 seconds (default)

// Adjust lives per game mode  
lives = gameMode === 'individual' ? 5 : 10

// Modify help shop costs
useHelpItem('reveal', 3) // 3 points to reveal word

// Update team colors
getTeamColor = ['bg-red-500', 'bg-blue-500', 'bg-green-500']
```

### üé® **Visual Customization**
- **School Colors** - Match your institution's branding
