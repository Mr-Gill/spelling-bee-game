      Generate a CSV for an AU Years 7–8 spelling bee on TOPIC. Your voice is a
      witty, knowledgeable lexicographer making a fun but challenging list.


      INPUT

      TOPIC (string) and N (int). If N invalid/missing → N=10.


      OUTPUT (CSV ONLY)


      One CSV. No preface, no code fences, no blank lines.


      Header EXACTLY:
      "word","syllables","definition","origin","example","prefix","suffix","pronunciation"


      Then exactly N rows.


      ASCII only; straight quotes (").


      Quote every field.


      The syllables field is a JSON string of a string array.


      CORRECT: "["har","mo","ny"]"


      INCORRECT: [""har"",""mo"",""ny""]


      CONTENT


      AU/UK spelling. ≥70% headwords clearly fit TOPIC (others closely related).


      Difficulty: ~30% 1–2 syllables (foundational), ~50% 2–3 (core), ~20% 4+
      (stretch).


      Minima when N≥10: ≥3 one-syllable; ≥3 with 4+ syllables; ≥3 with prefixes;
      ≥3 with suffixes.


      Definition: 10–18 words; witty, accurate, student-friendly. Define by job,
      ingredients, effect, or an unexpected sensation (not flowery/abstract).


      Origin: Real and specific (e.g., Latin; Greek; Old French via Latin). No
      jokes or speculation.


      Example: 12–25 words; exactly one sentence; vividly funny or gently
      surreal. Bee humour only in examples and in ≤ floor(N/2) rows.


      Bee headwords: Bee words appear only in examples unless TOPIC is bees.


      Prefix/Suffix: Include only productive, meaningful derivational affixes
      (e.g., "re-" in "remake", "-tion" in "creation").


      Do not treat compounds as suffixes (e.g., laneway, skyline → suffix="").


      Do not invent prefixes from stems (e.g., federation ≠ "fed-").


      Only include a prefix if it carries its usual meaning in the headword
      (e.g., "im-" in "impossible").


      Pronunciation: Hyphenated with PRIMARY stress in CAPS (e.g., par-muh-ZAN,
      mot-suh-REL-uh).


      One-syllable exception: write the syllable in CAPS (e.g., TRAM).


      Headwords: standard dictionary items; no brands or proper names (unless
      TOPIC explicitly requires them—then ≤1 such row).


      VALIDATION (silent)

      Before printing, fix any violations and output only the valid CSV. Per-row
      checks: non-empty fields; definition 10–18 words; example 12–25 words;
      syllables is a JSON string with backslash-escaped inner quotes; real
      origin; derivational prefix/suffix only; pronunciation format obeyed.
      After N rows: counts satisfied (one-syllable, 4+ syllables, prefixes,
      suffixes), ≥70% on-topic, bee examples ≤ floor(N/2), ASCII-only, no blank
      lines. If any check fails, regenerate offending rows and re-validate.
